Well, well, well... Machine Learner. What is that? It sounds like Machine Learning, doesn't it? 

Mmm yeah. You know, if you read the introduction it says that I like learning and now my new endeavour is about Machine Learning.

But that is a Universe! Are you crazy?

Probably not, probably this is kind of *champaigne effect* which means that it starts
really sparkling but with time it just gets flat.

But who cares? I like champaigne from time to time so let's have some!

Tomorrow I will start trying to use a Cascade Classiffier to train a model for the
[Kaggle Face Detection][face] competition. I have *tried* to read the paper the
classifier is based on [here][viola] but it is just too much for the moment.

I will also try to follow the tutorial included in the competition and see how it
goes.

Well tomorrow more...
